Omnivore is an interactive distributed SSH tool. Designed to quickly identify output anomalies and inconsistencies in large environments.

This program was developed alongside https://github.com/discoriver/massh, and is tightly integrated with it. It's my hope that Omnivore not only serves as a useful tool, but also as a demonstration of how one might utilise Massh elegantly to provide powerful programs that require advanced SSH output processing.

## Known Issues

- If using iTerm2 on MacOS, you will need to edit your profile, and under the `Terminal` heading, uncheck the option `Save lines to scrollback in alternate screen mode`. Leaving this option checked will cause major trauma to your scroll buffer when resizing the terminal window when Omnivore is running.
